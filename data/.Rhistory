#As a biologist I most often work with data in the long form. I have individuals animals
#or populations that are measured repeatedly over a period of time (sometimes over decades).
#Every measurement has to be one supposedly "independent" observation and on the dataset
#it has to correspond to one row only. This requires that some variable values (measurements
#that do not change during the course of time, such as sex) are repeated on each row.
#Of course the measurements are not independent if they are taken from the same individual
#or population. This is where mixed modelling and its random component are useful.
#In ecological data there is usually also either spatial or temporal correlation.
#Observations that are timely or spatially are more resembling and therefore correlated and
#not truly independent.
